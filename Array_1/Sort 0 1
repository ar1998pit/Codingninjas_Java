You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N that contains only integers, 0 and 1. 
Write a function to sort this array/list. 
Think of a solution which scans the array/list only once and don't require use of an extra array/list.

public class Solution {  

    public static void sortZeroesAndOne(int[] arr) {
    	//Your code goes here
        
        
        int n = arr.length;
        int count = 0;
       
        
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
                count = count+ arr[i];
        }
        
        for (int i=0; i<(n-count); i++){
            arr[i] = 0;
        }
        
        for (int i = (n-count);i<n;i++){
            arr[i] = 1;
        }
    }
}
